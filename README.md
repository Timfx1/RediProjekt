# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Possibilities**
For new people in Munich: they can locate nearest praxis
Problem: Data retrieval at a personal level: Individual saving particular information that is important for him
 Save and Sharing medical data that he thinks is necessary 
Easy availability and access to information
